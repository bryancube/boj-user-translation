		<p><a href="http://solved.ac">solved.ac</a> is a service created by the
			Sogang ICPC Team to help members practice algorithms. It has grown
			beyond Sogang University, now supporting thousands of users in their
			algorithm studies.</p>

		<p>The ICPC Team practices problem-solving on the Baekjoon Online Judge,
			which lacks difficulty ratings for its problems. Without these ratings,
			it was challenging for users to find appropriately difficult problems.
			This led to the creation of solved.ac, which now includes difficulty
			ratings for approximately 7,000 problems, thanks to contributions from
			over 200 users nationwide.</p>

		<p>The difficulty of a problem on solved.ac is determined based on the
			<strong>difficulty ratings</strong>
			submitted by users who have solved it. Each difficulty rating is a
			single integer representing the user's assessment of the problem's
			difficulty. The difficulty rating is calculated as follows:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>If no ratings have been submitted, the difficulty is set to
				0.</li>
			<li>If one or more ratings are available, the difficulty is
				determined using a 30% trimmed mean of all ratings.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>A trimmed mean excludes the extreme values at both ends to prevent
			them from distorting the average. For a 30% trimmed mean, the top 15%
			and bottom 15% of ratings are excluded before calculating the average.
			For example, if 20 users have submitted ratings, the 3 highest and 3
			lowest ratings are excluded.</p>

		<p>The number of excluded ratings at each end is rounded. For instance,
			if 25 users have voted, 15% of 25 is 3.75, which rounds to 4, meaning 4
			ratings from the top and 4 from the bottom are excluded.</p>

		<p>Finally, the computed mean is also rounded to the nearest integer.
			For example, if the trimmed mean is 16.7, the final difficulty is
			17.</p>

		<p>Given a list of user-submitted difficulty ratings for a problem,
			write a program that calculates the difficulty as determined by
			solved.ac.</p>

		<p>For 5 ratings, 15% is 0.75, which rounds to 1. Thus, solved.ac
			excludes the 1 highest and 1 lowest rating, calculating the difficulty
